# QR Onboarding System

A research-oriented and application-ready QR code reading system for reliable decoding under challenging camera and environmental conditions.

The project extends conventional QR scanning with adaptive preprocessing, enhanced decoding strategies, ROI tracking, multi-frame stabilization, payload-aware optimization, and evaluation tooling. It is designed both as a practical computer vision solution and as a structured experimental platform for studying robust QR decoding pipelines.

---

## Overview

Standard QR readers perform well in clean conditions, but their reliability often drops when the input is degraded by low light, blur, weak contrast, reflections, unstable framing, small QR size, or complex backgrounds. This project addresses those limitations through a modular architecture that improves decoding robustness for both still images and live camera streams.

The repository combines:

- practical QR scanning workflows
- enhanced preprocessing and recovery logic
- comparative binarization support
- live camera adaptation and ROI tracking
- payload-level optimization and split QR workflows
- benchmarking, validation, and statistical evaluation utilities

This makes the project suitable for:

- diploma and research work in computer vision
- comparative evaluation of QR recovery pipelines
- experiments on difficult real-world camera input
- demonstration of robust QR decoding under adverse conditions

---

## Target Conditions

The system is intended to improve QR decoding performance in conditions such as:

- low illumination
- motion blur and defocus blur
- small QR code footprint in the frame
- perspective distortion
- glare and reflections
- low contrast
- background clutter
- unstable live camera input
- payload complexity that reduces decoding robustness

---

## Key Capabilities

- QR code reading from still images
- QR code reading from live camera streams
- baseline and enhanced decoding pipelines
- adaptive preprocessing and threshold control
- multiple binarization strategies for difficult scenes
- ROI tracking for frame-to-frame focus refinement
- multi-frame support for unstable live input
- payload-aware QR processing and optimization
- split QR generation and reconstruction workflows
- statistical evaluation and benchmarking utilities
- modular components for console, API, and integration scenarios

## Architecture Summary

The system follows a modular QR reading workflow decomposed into distinct stages:

1. **Image acquisition**  
   Static image input or live camera frame capture

2. **Preprocessing**  
   Frame enhancement and preparation for downstream recovery

3. **Thresholding and binarization**  
   Adaptive and comparative strategies for improving QR separability

4. **Localization and ROI refinement**  
   Region selection and frame-to-frame tracking

5. **Decoding**  
   Baseline or enhanced QR extraction logic

6. **Temporal support**  
   Multi-frame stabilization and aggregation behavior

7. **Payload-level handling**  
   Encoding, optimization, splitting, and compatibility workflows

8. **Evaluation and benchmarking**  
   Statistical assessment, validation, and comparative measurement

This separation makes the repository suitable both for practical use and for research-grade experimentation.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure the following are available:

- Python 3.10 or newer
- a working virtual environment tool such as `venv`
- a webcam if you plan to test live camera functionality
- system support required by the QR decoding backend used by the project, if applicable on your platform

If you work on Windows, run all commands from the project root after activating the virtual environment.

---

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:bohdanaprokopchuk/qr_onboarding_system.git
cd qr_onboarding_system
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment

This repository uses a `src`-based layout. Before running the project, make sure Python can see the `src` directory.

#### Windows PowerShell

```powershell
$env:PYTHONPATH = "src"
```

#### Windows CMD

```cmd
set PYTHONPATH=src
```

#### Linux / macOS

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=src
```

### 5. Verify the installation

```bash

If this command runs successfully, the project is installed correctly.

---

## Quick Start

### Show CLI help

```bash
python -m qr_onboarding.cli --help
```

### Run batch processing on a dataset

#### Windows PowerShell or CMD

```powershell
python -m qr_onboarding.cli batch ".\assets\datasets" --pattern "**\*.png" --csv ".\results\batch_results.csv"

---

## Relevance

This project demonstrates not only a working QR decoding system, but also a structured experimental framework for evaluating robustness under difficult real-world conditions. The repository combines implementation, modular architecture, testing, and evaluation utilities in a way that supports both practical demonstration and comparative analysis.

The value comes from:
- extending standard QR decoding with enhanced recovery logic
- evaluating performance under adverse camera conditions
- comparing preprocessing and binarization strategies
- integrating ROI tracking and multi-frame stabilization
- supporting reproducible validation through scripts and automated tests

---

## Troubleshooting

### `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named qr_onboarding`
Set the project source path before running commands:

#### Windows PowerShell

```powershell
$env:PYTHONPATH = "src"
```

#### Windows CMD

```cmd
set PYTHONPATH=src
```

#### Linux / macOS

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=src
```

### CLI works, but the camera is unstable
Check the following:

- no other application is using the camera
- lighting is sufficient for live testing
- the camera is connected and available to the operating system
- you are launching the workflow from the project root with the virtual environment activated

### Dependencies install, but decoding fails on some systems
This can happen if the platform is missing external runtime support required by the QR decoding backend. In that case, verify that all project dependencies and any platform-specific decoder requirements are installed correctly.

---

## Conclusion

QR Onboarding System provides a modular and extensible framework for enhanced QR code reading from images and live camera streams. It combines practical computer vision methods with evaluation, benchmarking, and research tooling, making it suitable for both real-world experimentation and academic demonstration of robust QR decoding under challenging conditions.
